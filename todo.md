# TODO

- [X] Cloning and testing should happen in the background
- [X] The bot should reply to the PR saying if it's done or if there was an error

- [ ] Circle CI should build test images and push them to the repo
    This will increase the number of images and size since a single Gaia image is almost 4 gigs.
    Which means we need a cleanup of some kind.
